# Farm Stead Model's

We Uploaded **4 Models**.
2 Models for Crop Recomendation (Nazif Malhi)
1 Model for Fertilizer Recomendation (Nazif Malhi)
1 Model for Pest Detection (Noor us Sabbah)


## Pest Detection

Using the available pest attack dataset [Pest Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/6fa72c88863ff4d5c741cb6aa98ea7836b5db766d40642157a483dbb5c6a686f).
Implemented CNN model on the dataset of most common pest attacks occured to the crops.

The model is intended to classify the 9 different classes of pests targeted in our project scope that are "Aphids, army worm, saw fly, beetle, bollworm, grasshopper, mites, mosquito and stem borer.

## Crop Recomendation
### Crop Recomendation Model 1 (Simple)
[Simple Model](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayakumarv/crop-dataset) has simple features of an area like “soil, temperature, humidity, pH value and rainfall”. This dataset is targeted for the farmers who have no equipment or apparatus for testing the soil for advance features
### Crop Recomendation Model 2 (Advance)
This feature will also provide the second option for farmers who have the equipment to calculate the amount of minerals in the soil. For advance option, the other detailed dataset [Advance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shekharyada/croppredict)  used which will recommend the crop using the advance features like “percentage of Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus(P), Potassium(K) in soil along with the basic features used for the first option. The targeted crops that will be recommended by the application are: 

 1. rice
 2. maize
 3. chickpea
 4. kidney beans
 5. pigeon peas
 6. moth beans
 7. mung bean
 8. black gram
 9. lentil
 10. pomegranate
 11. banana
 12. mango
 13. grapes
 14. watermelon
 15. muskmelon
 16. apple
 17. orange
 18. papaya
 19. coconut
 20. cotton
 21. jute
 22. coffee

## Fertilizer Recomendation
 [Fertilizer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction) From Dataset the system will recommend the most suitable fertilizer that should be used for high yield of crops. The environmental and soil features like temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, percentage of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in soil are considered along with the crop type for the precise recommendation of suitable fertilizer for crop
Targeted Fertilizers are

 1. Urea
 2. DAP
 3. 28-28
 4. 20-20
 5. 17-17-17
 6. 14-35-14
 7. 10-26-2026
